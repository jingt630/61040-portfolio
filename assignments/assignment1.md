# Assignment 1
# Domains:

1. Gaming: I like gaming in both PC and mobile wise, sometimes with a controller. I've played many different types of games like MOBA, gacha, singleplayer open world, multiplayer, and etc. Some games need to be purchased and some are free but with in-game purchases. The one-time purchase games usually cost a lot but have amazing graphics, and the free games are mostly setup to encourage and promoting in-gaming purchases. For games that has an ending or set plot, I'm not really into replaying it again. For multiplayer games that doesn't have an ending like league, it's addictive to play but only with friends.


- Tracking Game Spent: Some games have in-game purchases and some players would make such purchases. I am also one of those money spending players for skins or characters. Most games that I've seen have weekly/monthly subscriptions, gacha (whether for characters/weapon/skins/etc), direct purchase, and etc. With game promotion, the desire of wanting things in game, and the lure of deals, it's hard to resist not spending anything for the game you love.

Reason for inclusion: I've never felt guilty until one day I calculated the total I spent for each game, and I want to keep reminding myself to fight against the desire of spending so much in a short time. I think plenty of players out there have the same issue that they aren't aware of much they had spent on gaming, especially if it's purchases over time. I think creating a software that reads the data on user's device to help remind them to think more or longer before making the purchase would help them rearrange their money allocation a little better.

Stakeholders:
1. Direct-users: The players of the game, whether they had spent money or not.
Some of the spending players might end up spending more than they intented to for a game. Over time, it might develop to be a bad habit of those players. For players who haven't spent anything yet, the in-game purchase lure is still there as long as they play the game, which can potentially progress into something they don't expect.

2. Game Developer/Company: The designers of the game and in-game purchases.
The companies are the one profitting from in-game purchase or one-time game purchases. Those purchases serve as a resource for the company to continue to grow and develop more games/other projects they have in mind.

3. Payment Platforms: The transaction facilitators.
The transaction facilitators are not really affected since they are responsible for secure transactions only.

Evidence:

1. (Avg Spending on Game)[https://www.fool.com/money/research/video-game-spending-statistics/] The average gaming spend per household is $435, but that is under the assumption that there's one gamer per household. These might not seem a lot in a year but household with kids spend about double of that.

2. (Parents think kids game too much)[https://www.reuters.com/article/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/parents-think-teens-spend-too-much-time-playing-video-games-idUSKBN1ZJ25L/] 86% of parents agreed that their teens spend too much time gaming, which impacts their sleep and school performance. Gaming has become part of a daily life in most teens which could lead to more potential purchases related to game.

3. (Microtransactions covers more of the PC market)[https://www.ccn.com/news/technology/gamers-spend-more-ugc-than-new-games/?utm_source=chatgpt.com] 58% of PC gamers are spending on in-game purchases and 28% are spent on full game purchases. Game developement constantly adds more cosmetic items as well as the availability of subscription services reshapes consumer habits.

4. (Only a small amount of players spend on games)[https://www.pocketgamer.biz/less-than-2-of-mobile-gamers-make-an-in-app-purchase/?utm_source=chatgpt.com] Only a small percentage, 1.83%, of users spend money on in-game purchases. The percentage that a user would spend again drops significantly every time they made one. The population affected by the problem might not be that massive or serious enough.

5. (Not a lot of players spent a lot every year)[https://www.statista.com/statistics/1481354/money-spent-mobile-games-us-adults/?utm_source=chatgpt.com] Of people who play on mobile games, half of the population only spent less than $50 dollars every year. No matter the age, players who spent over $500 dollars are at most 13%.

6. (People are prioritizing game spent over rent)[https://www.polygon.com/news/559840/japan-survey-twenty-year-old-gaming-spending-habits/?utm_source=chatgpt.com] 18.8% of respondents admitted to spending on in-game purchases to the point where it's affecting their living expenses. This supports how the identified problem actually exist and is applicable to a decent amount percentage of the population.

7. (Different reasons behind spending)[https://peerdh.com/blogs/programming-insights/psychological-triggers-in-microtransaction-spending?utm_source=chatgpt.com] Game designers often develop in-game purchases with scarcity, and players also want instant gratification. These are some of the reasons why players would spend money and this makes space for the need of a reminder to keep the instant gratification desire in check.

8. (How to help spend less on games)[https://gamequitters.com/in-game-spending-family-tips/] There are already plenty of methods to help players to spend less on games that doesn't require software programs like using gift cards to control one's budget or setting up parental controls. Players can also write down their spending every time, but that's where the limitation is. Sometimes we forget to track and can still end up spending too much.

9. (Regret on Spending)[https://www.statista.com/statistics/1192009/japan-share-teenagers-regret-spending-money-on-in-game-purchases/?utm_source=chatgpt.com] For Japanese teenager gamers, 22.9% of them regret spending money on in-game purchases. If this was a good population representation and we scale it up to the Japanese teenager population, this means there's a good amount of potential users who need this problem to be solved.

10. (Steam Feature as a comparable)[https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-tool-lets-you-see-just-how-much-money-youve-spent/1100-6530884/] Steam already has a feature where it helps users to tally how much they had spent on steam, but it's well hidden. This feature is only limited to Steam and doesn't include other platform transactions.

Features:
 - Total Spent Reminder: Displaying the total amount of money a user had spent so far on this current game right before they are planning to make another purchase, as well as the total amount across all of their games and platforms. This sets as a reminder to cool down the temptation of creating that purchase for the users to double think before hitting purchase.

 - Hard budget line: Users can setup to temporarily "freeze" their payment for a game after spending a total of the budget they have for themselves. This freezing feature should be setup by the user initially to help them cool off an impulse decision next time while they are still logical.

 - Post-purchase reflection nudges: Send really short notifications asking for a response from the user if the purchase they made some time ago is worth it. Once with some data of the user experience, keep sending/reminding them to become aware of long-term satisfaction with digital items, encouraging smarter choices.


- Problem 2: Not being able to find anyone to game and talk to for multiplayer games when friends are not available. Some games require 2 or more player to even start and some offer bots.
Exclusion Reason: Most multiplayer games have the feature of creating rooms and letting online players to join and game together.

- Problem 3: Some parents are against their child gaming so much, and some players also realize that they are too addicted to the game where it cost some kind of issue in their life like sleeping late.
Exclusion reason: Parents can setup screen time; for players who think they are too addicted, I feel like software isn't enough to remind and discpline them. This could mostly be more of a personal discpline problem or personal choice.

2. Listening and singing to Music

3. Gunpla Modeling

4. Watching medias from different countries: I'm into different medias produced by different countries, like c-drama,kpop, thai drama, japan shows, and anime. It's like a refresher to see and trying to understand culture differences. Due to copyrights, legal matters, or just promotional means, media resources are hard to acquire and understand. I often have to turn on vpns and browsing through different websites/platforms to find those media resources.

- Problem 1: Medias from different countries air at different platforms which may or may not be available in the US. Even when available, you would need to pay for the platform like Netflix. Videos on streaming platforms are also bounded by servers, where some videos are available in certain countries.

Exclusion Reason: Solving this would result in piracy and copyrights issues. The media companies setup those boundaries for their own protection and commerical reasons.

- Auto Translate and Re-edit: When we are consuming medias in other languages, some of them are raw (not translated). People might be interested in wanting to fully understand the video besides from just visual cues. Even if we can conviently copy and paste directly into a translator, there are jokes, traditions, or idioms that people from other cultures won't understand. This would require some background knowledge or researching apart from direct translation. When media throw in these jokes, it would also mess up the translation from translators like google translator.

Inclusion Reason: This seems like a promising problem that could be solve with AI text recognition to help with translation and culture explanation to speed up translation team productions. Text translation can be easily done, but now it's more about images and videos translation where more work and coordination are needed.

Stakeholders:
1. Direct users: Media consumers (not producers)
Consumers are mostly affected by this problem because they are the one who can't understand and enjoy the foregin media.

2. Translation/Localization Teams: The traditional group that helps to re-edit videos/images with translation while also adhering to the original art style of the media.
The problem produces a job but has high workload for complex foreign media translation with text being included in images.

3. Media Creators: The original content creators of the media.
Creators themselves have limited sources/time to translate their work when they are already creating them. Such limitation would at some level limit the global popularity of their work.


[we can train ai to recognize words (offical subtitles) and translate it not like google translate frame by frame. Could also auto remove captions from manga, translate, and redraw the captions in the same art style?? Help translation efficiently?]

Evidences:

1. (Challenge of Machine Translation)[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004224021035?utm_source=chatgpt.com] Machine translation often struggles with idiomatic expressions, metaphors, humor, and other culturally specific elements, as their meaning may not be directly translatable. Not to mention our problem includes text recognition from images.

2. (AI help with translating medias)[https://superagi.com/from-hours-to-minutes-mastering-efficient-video-subtitling-with-ai-powered-tools-and-techniques/]An comparable attempt for transcripting and translating with AI-powered tools. AI tools help with formatting and styling subtitiles and saves time. Plenty of media consumers prefer to watch videos in their native languages making subtitles important.

3. (Time consumption for translation)[https://www.reddit.com/r/TranslationStudies/comments/p64u9d/how_long_would_it_take_to_subtitle_60min/?utm_source=chatgpt.com]Just making and translating an hour long video with subtitles take about 12 to 18 hours of work.

4. (Cost of Subtitling)[https://golocalise.com/blog/subtitling-rates-guide/?utm_source=chatgpt.com]Professional subtitling services for videos cost around $13-$19 per minute, which I don't think most leisure media consumer are willing to pay.

5. (Time consumption for images)[https://www.reddit.com/r/manga/comments/37dp19/sl_how_long_does_it_take_a_chapter_to_get/?utm_source=chatgpt.com] There are many steps traditional translating teams would have to do including purchasing the media before scanning and translating. Cleaning, redrawing, and  quality check all in total requires around 6 hours for just one chapter.

6. (Potential of Localizing Videos)[https://localizejs.com/articles/video-translation-localization-guide] There are 5 billion internet users and 90% watch videos every week, so there's a huge amount of media consumers. With the internet, users are also consuming medias with different language. Translation can help with exposing the videos/images to more audiences.

7. (Diverse Language Media Consumption)[https://www.gwi.com/blog/foreign-language-media] Almost of US media consumers are in favor of watch foreign language medias, and such medias are also gaining recognition globally. This shows the potential of faster and more often localization/translation needed for the demand.

8. (Languages used on the internet)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_used_on_the_Internet] English is the most used language on the internet, but besides that, other languages only takes less than 6% each. There's still plenty of space for localization or translation needed when internet users are browsing through medias.

9. (AI in video localization)[https://pitchavatar.com/how-ai-is-transforming-video-translation-and-localization/] There are comparables out there using AI in speed recognizing speech to generate translation. Benefits include cost-efficiency and scalability. One limitation would be emotional dubbing.

10. (Existence of Scalation)[https://whatismanga.wordpress.com/2019/04/12/43-why-do-scanlations-persist/] Scalation still exist due to there always being a demand for quicker translation. Official translation are not keeping up with the pace of the demand of the consumers.

Features:

- AI text and context detection from images: Using AI to quickly help clean and redraw images/frames, localizing and translating the subtitles can speed up scalation productions. This not only benefits the end users by the speed of the production, but also content creators to publized their work globally.

- Collaboration Mode: Allow translation teams and other editors to correct and suggest edits made by AI. This address the accuracy of using AI in localization and seeing the quality of the AI work since it's not the best yet in image processing.

- Multi-layer and language Subtitles: A bonus feature for different kinds of end users who want to watch the content or also learn the foregin language/culture as they watch. Users can toggle what language subtitles or bilangual subtitles, and with AI, more languages can be translated and be translated to.

- Problem 3: There's multiple verisons of the same media depending on the area of the users. Medias in different country and platforms have their own set of rules that might result in cutting off some of the parts. Depending on the streaming platforms, some has bonus scenes or localized content.
Exclusion Reason: The problem have to do with copyrights and the problem isn't serious enough or widespread enough. Most people can look for posts online that guides them where to access such medias.

5. Traveling: I mostly travel to places where I know someone who's a local there or for school/event purposes only. When I want to travel to somewhere new with my friends, none of us really want to do the planning because it's really a hassel to look through different resources to plan the different parts of the trip: hotel, transportation, food, tourist attraction, and local attraction. Traveling with friends would also mean having tons of conditions and finding common grounds where everyone agrees on. I would love to travel more to new places without spending unreasonable prices and having to spend hours on searching/planning. Experiencing new things, even if challenges, are part of the traveling experience to me when traveling overseas.

- Problem 1: The biggest hassel is having to look through hours and hours of resources to validate what we are expecting on the trip, whether it's the hotel quality or attraction expectation. There are indeed lots of platforms where people share their reviews, photos, and tips on certain places as well as booking websites. However, it's hard to organize all of the informations in one place for the user to see simulatenously to help them vision the trip schedule.

Exclusion Reason: There are already plenty of booking and trip planning websites like Expedia out there already. It's well known by lots of users already, and picking this problem to solve might result in an Expedia similar clone.

- Problem 2: There are still many things booking or trip planning websites don't have like cultural norms information, currency exchange, wait times, rush seasons, visa requirements, SIM card prep, and many additional actions a traveler would need beyond booking and planning. Such information requires even more time to research and prepare for trip smoothness and safety.

Inclusion Reason: This problem is applicable to many, widespread enough, likely to be solved with data collection, and could be really helpful if project is completed.The preparation part of traveling are less talked about and this project might be helpful for beginner travelers.

Stakeholders:
1. Direct/End Users: the travelers
Travelers are usually stressed by the said problem and might lead to a frustrating vacation where money and time are wasted.

2. Potential Partners: Travel Agencies, booking websites, other product/service agents
Potential partners can have limited information on those small important information that might impact on the deals they have for their service. This can lead to customer dissatisfaction or pressure to expand services. Other product/service agents like SIM card or currency exchanging parties might not be brought to traveler's attention.

3. Regulators: Border Controls or custom authorities
The lack of attention travelers have for visa/health/other requirements when traveling to another country, can add up the work for regulators. But it's not a really heavy influence since it's the regulators' job to begin with anyway.

Evidence:
1. (number of Americans who travel in 2024)[https://www.statista.com/chart/31152/share-of-us-respondents-who-have-taken-private-trips/] In one year, about 71% of Americans travel at least once for private trips. Most people travels, showing the potential amount of users that might need this problem solved.

2. (Survey on people's time and stress on trip planning)[https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogersands/2025/01/17/americans-cite-overspending-as-top-vacation-challenge-survey-reveals/] People on average spend more than half of a day on travel planning, causing frustration, and thinking they are overspending.

3. (Comparable of attempting to solve)[https://www.pcmag.com/news/the-pros-and-cons-of-travel-apps-and-websites]With plenty of traveling apps out there, most are satisfied with how those websites/applications help them save time and money. Yet, pain points like price change, limited options, and not enough flexibility are still out there.

4. (The traveling mindset for different generations)[https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/travel/our-insights/the-way-we-travel-now] The younger generation has growing interest in traveling even international travels, and are willing to spend more. However, people do also enjoy planning trips themselves instead of having to use travel agents to have full control of where, when, and what they are doing.

5. (Comparable of an "all in one travel planner")[https://www.stippl.io/] Uses AI to help plan and includes many different features including esim, budget tracker, itinerary planner, packing list, travel tracker, and etc. Looks really promising but doesn't go for helping users to seek for traveling deals. The amount of users for this app has only reached 230,000 users worldwide, which might not be enough users to guide each other when reviewing and traveling.

6. (Pros and cons of travel agents)[https://travel.usnews.com/features/the-pros-and-cons-of-using-a-travel-agent] Planning with a travel agent helps save time and has local expertise/recommendations. However, it's not flexible and not always the cheapest.

7. (Tech in Traveling)[https://www.software.travel/blog/tips/how-technology-changing-travel-industry/] Survey respondents are looking forward to potential technologies in helping them personalize their trip. It's also shown after covid-19, people planning to use different sort of apps to help them with their travel.

8. (Potential Problems when travel planning)[https://www.quora.com/Is-it-worth-paying-for-the-travel-websites-plans-when-planning-a-trip] Having help or plans ready for users saves lots of hassle, but there also even more problems like currency, visa, and money saving.

9. (What Travel Planning Startups are missing)[https://www.travelmassive.com/posts/why-most-travel-planning-startups-miss-the-mark-554943365]Travelers often have to spend numerous amount of time on validating if the information is reliable and cross-verify liability as well as pricing. Most websites out there leads to more websites travelers have to look through for. Successful trip planner should allow the trip planning aspect for the users, but without the need of doomscrolling and reducing friction for users.

10. (Typical issues when traveling in another area)[https://gatewayeduconnect.com/blog/5-issues-that-may-hinder-you-from-traveling-abroad-and-how-to-solve-them?utm_source=chatgpt.com] A list of travel precautions and potential issues one might have while traveling that includes everything mentioned in the problem above.

Features:
 - Crowd Sourced Real-Time Conditions: Like how google map tracks real-time traffic with how much phones in one road, travelers can get to know if an attractions or just any location is flooded with people. This gives flexbility and ease the stress for travelers giving their full control of their trip.

 - Trip Knowledge Share: Encourage users or even locals of locations to leave hacks/tips for other travelers that other booking or travel agents might not have. This not only helps future travelers, but also local businesses of the destination.

 - Internation Travel Prep Assistant: Compiles all the documents, process, currency exchange locations, and the steps in order a traveler would have to do if wanting to travel over sea. This saves user time and complexity of needing to run here and there to get their visa or other safety requirements done.


- Problem 3: Photography is another essential to traveling as one of the prove that someone really traveled to there. The desire of getting a good shot during vacation or snapping a photo with the same pose and/or at the same place as someone are some reasons why one travel. However, some don't really know how to layout, angle their phone, or know when is the best time of a place to snap a photo to avoid rush hours.

Exlusion Reason: Users can easily search up pictures of the location on spot and just borrow other people's idea of photography. This feature might not be really needed since the problem is really that serious.




6. Ordering takeouts and eating out

7. Hanging out with friends

8. Driving

9. Working Remotely

10. Grocery Shopping




# Brainstorm:-------------------------------
1. Push notification for email follow up:
Sometimes we see the notification on our phone and then we swiped it after reading it, thinking that we will come back to it later. However, because we push the notification away, if we don't check outlook, we would forget about it at the back of our head.

2. Game spending or just showing money spent in each app in total??
as a reminder or bring guilt if the user want to save money
Games itself won't show how much you spent on them in total in order to keep the cash coming. We also don't realize how much we have spent, especially for gacha systems.

3. Combine and purchase with others to fulfill free shipping or split shipping fees for MIT students (same dorms or neighbor dorms) in terms of either delivery or uber eats

However, most people have amazon prime and people want to eat from different places at uber eats
