# Assignment 1

1. Gaming: I like gaming in both PC and mobile wise, sometimes with a controller. I've played many different types of games like MOBA, gacha, singleplayer open world, multiplayer, and etc. Some games need to be purchased and some are free but with in-game purchases. The one-time purchase games usually cost a lot but have amazing graphics, and the free games are mostly setup to encourage and promoting in-gaming purchases. For games that has an ending or set plot, I'm not really into replaying it again. For multiplayer games that doesn't have an ending like league, it's addictive to play but only with friends.


- Problem 1: Some games have in-game purchases and some players would make such purchases. I am also one of those money spending players for skins or characters. Most games that I've seen have weekly/monthly subscriptions, gacha (whether for characters/weapon/skins/etc), direct purchase, and etc. With game promotion, the desire of wanting things in game, and the lure of deals, it's hard to resist not spending anything for the game you love. I started with being a frugal player but once I start putting money in, I continue to keep buying skins/characters. If I add up all the in-game money I spent for just two of my games, it's probably $2000. Not to mention also the number of games I purchased in steam. I've never felt guilty until one day I calculated the total I spent for each game, and I want to keep reminding myself to fight against the desire of spending so much in a short time. I think plenty of players out there have the same issue that they aren't aware of much they had spent on gaming, especially if it's purchases over time. I think creating a software that reads the data on user's device to help remind them to think more or longer before making the purchase would help them rearrange their money allocation a little better.

- Problem 2: Not being able to find anyone to game and talk to for multiplayer games when friends are not available. Some games require 2 or more player to even start and some offer bots. I'm excluding this because most multiplayer games have the feature of creating rooms and letting online players to join and game together.

- Problem 3: Some parents are against their child gaming so much, and some players also realize that they are too addicted to the game where it cost some kind of issue in their life like sleeping late. For me, if I don't game enough a day, I just don't feel satisfied and don't want to sleep even when tired. I'm excluding this one because parents wise they can setup screen time. For players who think they are too addicted, I feel like software isn't enough to remind and discpline them. Just reminders or what software programs can do won't do much.

4. Watching medias from different countries: I'm into different medias produced by different countries, like c-drama,kpop, thai drama, japan shows, and anime. I'm

- Problem 1: Medias from different countries air at different platforms which may or may not be available in the US. Even when available, you would need to pay for the platform like Netflix. Videos on Netflix are also bounded by servers, where some videos are available in certain countries.

# Brainstorm:-------------------------------
1. Push notification for email follow up:
Sometimes we see the notification on our phone and then we swiped it after reading it, thinking that we will come back to it later. However, because we push the notification away, if we don't check outlook, we would forget about it at the back of our head.

2. Game spending or just showing money spent in each app in total??
as a reminder or bring guilt if the user want to save money
Games itself won't show how much you spent on them in total in order to keep the cash coming. We also don't realize how much we have spent, especially for gacha systems.

3. Combine and purchase with others to fulfill free shipping or split shipping fees for MIT students (same dorms or neighbor dorms) in terms of either delivery or uber eats

However, most people have amazon prime and people want to eat from different places at uber eats
