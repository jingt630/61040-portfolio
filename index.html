  <p>Momonga is often mean and selfish. They act cute and beg for all sorts of things.
    They are very self-centered, and will often shamelessly demand things or refuse to
    share. Even during dangerous situations, they will ask for food and rest. In
    pursuit of Momonga's core motivation to "act cute", they make a conscious effort
    to imitate other characters' cute actions, notably Chiikawa. They often imitate
    Chiikawa's yawning and crying. They exhibit traits of malignant narcissism.</p>
